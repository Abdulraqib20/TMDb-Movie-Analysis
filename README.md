## Introduction </br>
This is a part of the projects I did in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Programme.
The data set contains observation of about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. You can find more about the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset). In this project, I'm going to investigate the dataset to find out the movies with highest profits, hits and other interesting stuff about movies from the data.</br>

## With the insights I gathered from my analysis, I was able to answer some questions which includes; <br>
What movies had the highest and least revenue?<br>
What movies had the highest and least budget?<br>
Movies with the highest runtime<br>
Genres with the highest and lowest runtime.<br>
Most profitabale movies<br>
Hit movies!(most popular movies)<br>
Number of movie genres released over the years<br>
Most popular genres<br>
Month and Days with highest number of movie releases.
